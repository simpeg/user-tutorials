A set of user tutorials for SimPEG. Visit [https://simpeg.xyz/user-tutorials/](https://simpeg.xyz/user-tutorials/).

For those developing tutorials and wishing to build the website locally, some trouble shooting items are:

* Updating MyST: `pip install -U mystmd`
* After updating, `myst clean --all` to clean cached templates
