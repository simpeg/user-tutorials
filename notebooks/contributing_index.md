Contributing to User Tutorials
==============================

We greatly appreciate efforts made by the SimPEG community to improve available tutorial material.
This includes:

* improving the content within preexisting tutorials, and
* adding a new tutorials

However, tutorials must adhere to specific guidelines in order to ensure a high level of quality and consistency.
Some of the things we would like to avoid are:

* tutorials created for the purpose of self promotion
* tutorials that focuss primarily on functionality that is not part of SimPEG
* tutorials containing data-specific results, where choices in parameter values are not generally applicable

For those interested in contributing to SimPEG User Tutorials, please follow the instructions provided.


Steps for Adding a Tutorial
---------------------------

As explained on the [SimPEG user tutorials](../index.md) landing page, the SimPEG user tutorials are a library of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that have been published as a website using [MyST](https://mystmd.org/). To add a tutorial notebook to the project, you will need to complete the following steps:

**Step 1: Building the User Tutorials Website Locally**

First, you will need all of the functionality required to run the existing tutorial notebooks and build the website locally with [MyST][mystmd.org].
Instructions for creating an appropriate Python environment and building the website locally are found on the [Building the User Tutorials Website Locally](contributing/build_website.md) page.

**Step 2: Creating a Tutorial Notebook**

Jupyter notebooks that contain tutorials must adhere to specific structure and formatting requirements.
These are provided on the [Tutorial Structure and Formatting Requirements](contributing/formatting.md) page.

**Step 3: Review Process and GitHub Pull Requests**

Any proposed changes to SimPEG user tutorials must be submitted for a review as a GitHub pull request.
Please visit our [Review Process and GitHub Pull Requests](contributing/pull_request.md) page.
