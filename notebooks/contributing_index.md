Contributing to User-Tutorials
==============================

User tutorials have become the primary resource for SimPEG users to learn the code base and best-practices for computational geophysics.
To ensure a high level of consistency and quality, specific guidelines need to be followed when adding new tutorial notebooks.
New tutorial notebooks will not be published until our guidelines have been followed.

Before You Create a Tutorial
----------------------------

Although we greatly appreciate efforts by the SimPEG community to create new tutorials,
we must ensure the contents of the tutorial are appropriate. As a result,
we discourage tutorials that fall into the following categories:

* the tutorial focusses on functionality that is not part of SimPEG
* the amount of SimPEG functionality that has not already been covered in another tutorial is insufficient
* the tutorial focusses on a data-specific result and is not generalizable
* the tutorial was created for purpose of self promotion


How to Contribute
-----------------

To add a new notebook to SimPEG user tutorials, you will need to complete the following three steps:

1. Follow the instructions on the [Cloning the Repository and Building the Website](getting_started.md) page.
These instructions explain how to clone the SimPEG user tutorials repository, setup the appropriate Python
environment, and build the website locally with MyST.

2. Create a notebook according to the [Structure and Formatting for Notebooks](notebook_formatting.md) page.

3. Create a GitHub pull request.
