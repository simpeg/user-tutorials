Contributing to User Tutorials
==============================

SimPEG welcomes contributions by the community to improve available tutorial materials.
However, tutorials must adhere to specific guidelines in order to ensure a high level of quality and consistency.
For those interested in contributing to SimPEG User Tutorials, please follow the instructions provided.


Before Creating a New Tutorial
------------------------------

```{admonition} WARNING!
:class: danger
Please ensure that the contents of your tutorial **DOES NOT** fall into any of the following categories:

* the tutorial focusses on functionality that is not part of SimPEG
* the amount of SimPEG functionality NOT already covered in another tutorial is insufficient
* the tutorial focusses on a data-specific result and is not generalizable
* the tutorial was created for the purpose of self promotion

Tutorials that fall into any of these categories will not be accepted!
```

Steps for Adding a Tutorial
---------------------------

As explained on the [SimPEG user tutorials](../index.md) landing page, the SimPEG user tutorials are a library of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that have been published as a website using [MyST](https://mystmd.org/). To add a tutorial notebook to the project, you will need to complete the following steps:

**Step 1: Building the User Tutorials Website Locally**

First, you will need all of the functionality required to run the existing tutorial notebooks and build the website locally with [MyST][mystmd.org].
Instructions for creating an appropriate Python environment and building the website locally are found on the [Building the User Tutorials Website Locally](contributing/build_website.md) page.

**Step 2: Creating a Tutorial Notebook**

Jupyter notebooks that contain tutorials must adhere to specific structure and formatting requirements.
These are provided on the [Tutorial Structure and Formatting Requirements](contributing/formatting.md) page.

**Step 3: The Review Process**
