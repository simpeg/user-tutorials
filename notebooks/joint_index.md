Joint Inversion
===============

Joint inversion represents approaches for inverting two or more geophysical datasets simultaneously. Datasets may relate to the same diagnostic physical property (e.g. MT and ZTEM), or may relate to different physical properties (e.g. gravity and EM). Here, we provide a multitude of indermediate and advanced level tutorials for joint inversion of geophysical data. Links to each tutorial can be accessed below or from the left-side menu.
